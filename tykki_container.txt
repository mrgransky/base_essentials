Pipeline Steps:

Phase 1: Disable Old Conda Setups in Your User Environment
$ cd
$ vim ~/.bashrc
Comment out or delete the line:

# export PATH="/projappl/project_2004072/CondaCSC/bin:$PATH"

Save and exit.

Apply ~/.bashrc Changes and Verify:

The most reliable way is to log out of Puhti and log back in.

Alternatively, for the current session (less complete than a fresh login): source ~/.bashrc

Verify:

$ echo $PATH
$ which conda
$ which python

Phase 2: Delete the Old CondaCSC Directory Content

$ module purge
$ module load tykky
$ cd /projappl/project_2004072/
$ ls -l CondaCSC

$ mv -v CondaCSC CondaCSC_OLD_$(date +%Y%m%d)
# # Then, after confirming the new one works, you can delete CondaCSC_OLD_*

Recreate the Empty Directory for the New Installation:
We need an empty directory for Tykky to install into.

$ mkdir CondaCSC

Phase 3: Create the New Tykky Environment (Named CondaCSC)

This phase uses Tykky to build a fresh, clean environment.

Prepare environment.yml and requirements.txt:

Create environment.yml (e.g., in your home directory or /projappl/project_2004072/) with your desired Conda packages.
$ vim environment.yml

name: CondaCSC_env
channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python=3.9

Create requirements.txt (in the same location) for pip packages.

$ conda-containerize new --prefix CondaCSC environment.yml

Phase 4: Set Up PATH for the New CondaCSC Environment

$ cd
$ vim ~/.bashrc

# At the end of ~/.bashrc
export PATH="/projappl/project_2004072/CondaCSC/bin:$PATH"

Save and exit.
Log out of Puhti and log back in (most reliable).

Or source ~/.bashrc.

Verify:

$ echo $PATH

$ which python
$ which pip
$ which conda # This might still be a shell function, but should now operate in context of Tykky wrappers

which python and pip should now point to locations inside /projappl/project_2004072/CondaCSC/bin/.
$ cd /projappl/project_2004072/
$ rm -rfv CondaCSC_OLD_*

Test the New Environment:
$ which python
$ python --version

continue with package installation:
$ module purge
$ module load tykky
# modify packages.sh file: <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
$ conda-containerize update CondaCSC --post-install packages.sh
